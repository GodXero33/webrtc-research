# webrtc-research

I’m not here to use libraries. I’m here to **understand** how WebRTC actually works.

This repo is a collection of raw experiments with real-time audio, video, and data streaming.
No frameworks. No hand-holding. Just native browser APIs and suffering until it makes sense.

If it breaks, good.
If it works, I probably learned something.
